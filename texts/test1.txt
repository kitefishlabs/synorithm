This works much better.

The improbable thing of the whole thing is that, when the soda and water and cocaine are mixed right and heated right and stirred just right as the mix cools down, then when the stuff’s too stiff to stir and is finally ready to come on out it comes out slick as shit from a goat, just an inverted ketchup bottle thump and out the son of a fucking whore slides, one molded cylinder hard-ended onto the black wire, its snout round from the glass tube’s bottom. The average pre-chopped freebase rock looks like a .38 round.

Where irony comes in is anyone with an average brain notes that I'm making fun of it but I'm also part of it. Now there's two ways I can go -- I can change the situation, because it's clearly ridiculous, or I can ironically genuflect the situation -- 'Isn't this great? I'm a dickhead, sitting here watching these dickheads watch dickheads on TV.' And it becomes, it seems to me, a very easy excuse to perpetuate the deal. It's a way to keep doing what's easy and convenient and yet look hip and cool while you're doing it.
